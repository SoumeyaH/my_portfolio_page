## Description

As potential employees we were tasked with creating a web portfolio for a potential employer to be able to view a deployed portfolio of our work samples.

### What Was Done

- Created a website with a responsive layout using CSS flexbox and media queries.
- The page has sections titled About Me, Contact Me, and My Portfolio.
  - Sections have corresponding functioning links in the navigation bar.
- The portfolio section:
  - The first application's image is larger than the others.
  - The image for the application links to the deployed site.
- Added CSS animation and used CSS variable.
- The HTML document and CSS stylesheet code were formatted using lint (prettier).

In the future the portfolio section will be updated as new projects are developed and deployed. Furthermore, the website could be improved by making it more dynamic using javascript.

- Navigate into project and open in VSCode.
- Open the index.html file in broswer preferably.
